# Cringe-Speak
Converts your input to any of these cringe _dialects_:

- **UwU**: Transforms text into a cutesy, over-exaggerated style often associated with anime fan communities. It involves altering certain letters and sounds (e.g., "r" to "w", adding "uwu") to create a playful, child-like tone.

- **SaRcAsM**: Alternates between lowercase and uppercase letters to convey a mocking or ironic tone. This mimics the way people sometimes speak when they are being sarcastic.

- **Emoji ðŸ˜€**: Extends words or phrases with relevant emojis to add a visual and often humorous element to the message. This can make the text more engaging or convey emotions more vividly.
